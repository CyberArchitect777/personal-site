                <p>I started my
                    coding journey early in life, learning to program in BASIC at a young age on an old Amstrad
                    CPC464. I had only an instruction manual and a curious mind, but I was inspired by the possibilities
                    I could see in the words. My interest in technology only grew from there and after school, I
                    embarked on a university education in the field and attained a degree and a masters degree.</p>
                <p>However, my life did not progress as I had envisaged, family responsibilities came to the fore and I
                    spent a number of years in a caring role, first informally, and then formally. Despite this, my life
                    circumstances have recently changed, and with a move to a new area, I'm keen to return to the
                    profession I had always imagined myself doing.</p>

                                I have a high level of <strong>attention to detail</strong> and have demonstrated my
                                ability to focus on my tasks in both my education and professional life. I am
                                experienced with <strong>systematic record keeping</strong> in my caring role. My job
                                also required me to administer nutrition and medication on a schedule. I showed in this
                                role that I could achieve this and also manage unexpected scenarios that might result in
                                a change of circumstances. On top of this, as the only <strong>IT support
                                    employee</strong>, I was required to lead and manage all problems in these
                                areas <strong>without supervision.</strong> Being able to <strong>multitask</strong>
                                was key in managing both technical and care-related tasks as required.

                                As one of the lead personnel in my workplace, I was able to have a positive effect
                                through the personal <strong>construction, evaluation and modification of
                                    protocols</strong>. One example
                                of this is how I devised a new process to aid pain relief by releasing trapped air
                                during feeding, previously a significant problem for a number of years. Computing is
                                full of technological problems that arise that require analytical and
                                sometimes imaginative solutions to resolve. These can range from networking, computer
                                repair, software faults, programming bugs and so on. I have faced these both at work and
                                in my personal life, both for myself and other people I have helped.

                                In my employment, I have demonstrated the ability to work successfully as part of a
                                <strong>small team of varied people</strong>, often in <strong>time-pressured and
                                    stressful circumstances</strong>. As a
                                result of my experience, I had a key role in <strong>supporting the development of
                                    others</strong> in the
                                workplace. I regularly <strong>trained new staff members</strong> as they joined and
                                mentored them as
                                they gained experience. On top of this, I also led in ensuring all tasks were completed
                                as required on a daily basis. A key priority was making sure all of this was done in a
                                non-confrontational manner in order to maintain team <strong>functionality and
                                    harmony</strong>.

                                special-needs. I showed that I could be trusted to carry this out, even in situations
                                where it could be critical for survival. I also was trusted to manage the <strong>IT

                                Part of this is having a <strong>positive attitude</strong> to work and approaching any
