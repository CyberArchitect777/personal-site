                <p>I started my
                    technology journey early in life, learning to program in BASIC at a young age on an old Amstrad
                    CPC464. I had only an instruction manual and a curious mind, but I was inspired by the possibilities
                    I could see in the words. My interest in technology only grew from there and after school, I
                    embarked on a university education in the field and attained a degree and a masters degree.</p>
                <p>However, my life did not progress as I had envisaged, family responsibilities came to the fore and I
                    spent a number of years in a caring role, first informally, and then formally. Despite this, my life
                    circumstances have recently changed and after completing full-stack web development training with
                    Code Institute, I started work for Crowe UK as an Alteryx Developer.</p>
                <p>From there, I gained Designer Core and Advanced certifications while working on a variety of
                    projects at Crowe, both big and small. My role has now expanded beyond Alteryx into KNIME workflows, Python development
                    and FastAPI web-based solutions. I also actively follow my professional development plan,
                    building my software portfolio and expanding my skills in key technologies including Power BI</p>

                                As a software engineering graduate, I'm very familiar with the
                                <strong>problem-solving</strong> and
                                <strong>way-of-thinking</strong> that is required to be a programmer and was
                                additionally exposed to it
                                at a very young age. In addition, computing is full of technological problems that arise
                                that require analytical and sometimes imaginative solutions to resolve. These can range
                                from networking, computer repair, software faults, workflow design, programming bugs and
                                so on. I have
                                faced these both at work and in my personal life, both for myself and other people I
                                have helped. I have additionally been able to
                                apply these skills as one of the lead personnel in my past caring role by
                                <strong>constructing,
                                    evaluating and
                                    modifying protocols</strong> for a positive effect. One example of this is how I
                                devised a new
                                process to aid pain relief by releasing trapped air during feeding, previously a
                                significant problem for a number of years.

                                    Institute</strong>, I worked in teams during <strong>hackathons</strong> under
                                immense pressure and demostrated that I could make this both successful and collaborate
                                effectively. In my caring role and at Crowe UK, I have
                                demonstrated the ability to work well as part of a
                                <strong>small team of varied people</strong>, often in <strong>time-pressured and
                                    stressful circumstances</strong>. In the first of these roles, I had a key role in
                                <strong>supporting the development of
                                    others</strong> in the
                                workplace. I regularly <strong>trained new staff members</strong> as they joined and
                                mentored them as
                                they gained experience. On top of this, I also led in ensuring all tasks were completed
                                as required on a daily basis. A key priority was making sure all of this was done in a
                                non-confrontational manner in order to maintain team <strong>functionality and
                                    harmony</strong>, a factor that has also proven very useful in my
                                <strong>professional role at Crowe</strong>.

                                At Crowe, I have showed my <strong>responsibility and commitment</strong> by managing
                                projects and being responsible for how they progressed, often independently of others.
                                In addition, as part of my caring role, I was required to take care of the well-being of

                                special-needs. I showed that I could be trusted to carry this out, even in situations
                                where it could be critical for survival. I also was trusted to manage the <strong>IT

                                Part of this is having a <strong>positive attitude</strong> to work and approaching any
